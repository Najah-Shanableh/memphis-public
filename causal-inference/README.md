# Causal inference

We wanted to know if various actions taken on distressed properties
had an effect on property values nearby. We used the machinery of
[causal inference](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Causal_inference) to estimate
the effects of investment in distressed properties and demolitions
of distressed properties.

More information on the analysis and how to run the code is [on the wiki](https://www.github.com/dssg/memphis-public/).
