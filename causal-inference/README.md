# Causal inference

We wanted to know if various actions taken on distressed properties
had an effect on property values nearby. We used the machinery of
[causal inference](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Causal_inference) to
estimate the effects of investment in distressed properties and
demolitions of distressed properties. Results were largely inconclusive.

More information on the analysis and how to run the code is
[on the wiki](https://www.github.com/dssg/memphis-public/wiki/CausalInference).

This code specifically looks at the effect of rehabilitations on
sales.  We also created a [tool to simulate the effect of a
rehabilitation](https://www.github.com/dssg/memphis-public/tree/master/comparable-simulation) on surrounding assessed values.
